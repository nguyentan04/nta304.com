               <h3>3. Who are the recipients of the data collected?</h3>
               <p>The data collected on the Sites and Apps are intended for AT Infos.</p>
               <p>They may be transmitted or accessed by the service providers of AT Infos in the context of performing processing, data analysis and computer services.</p>
               <p>AT Infos requires its service providers to only use your personal data to manage the services entrusted to them, in accordance with the regulations applicable for the protection of personal data and confidentiality of this data.</p>
               <p><span>AT Infos informs you that it has reached agreements with the business partners that may collect data about you. AT Infos has no visibility regarding this data. We invite you to consult the list of our main partners in the policy on cookies:

            </div>
            <div>
               <h3>4. Where is your personal data stored?</h3>
               <p>Your personal data is stored inside the European Union, either in our databases or in those of our service providers.</p>
               <p>In some cases, and mainly for technical reasons, data may be stored on servers located outside the European Union.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <h3>5. Data transfers outside the EU</h3>
               <p>Due in particular to the international dimension of AT Infos, some of our partners are located outside the European Union. The data collected may therefore be transferred to countries outside the European Union which have different personal data protection legislation from those inside the European Union.</p>
               <p>In this case, AT Infos implements the means to ensure the security and confidentiality of such data and ensures that the transfer meets the legal framework: the transfer to a country ensuring a sufficient level of protection, signature of contractual clauses issued by the European Commission, or any other regulatory or contractual means to ensure a sufficient level of protection.</p>
               <p>AT Infos strictly requires its partners to only use your personal data to manage or provide the services requested, and also asks its partners to always act in compliance with the applicable laws on personal data protection and pay particular attention to the confidentiality of such data.</p>
               <p>Transfers outside the European Union may be carried out, in particular, as part of our subsequent activities such as computer services on the systems in AT Infos.</p>
            </div>
            <div>

               <p>Personal data is stored for the duration required for the processing purposes for which it was collected except where retention for a longer duration is required by law, regulations or for trial purposes.</p>
